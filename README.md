## My Build

I have always been a fan of this project, the community is amazing and I have done several versions of it including voice with alexa, mp3 player and all. This is the "latest" one (from last year), which I found laying on my HDD.

I won't publish my personal code because there is a lot of personal data which I would have to scrape and it's a pain in the ass.
HOWEVER, I will be more than happy to help people build something similar to mine or just try to help them with whatever they are struggling with.

Modules I used in this build are:
  * Calendar
  * Clock
  * Internet-monitor
  * MMM-Alexa
  * MMM-cryptocurrency
  * mm-music-player
  * twitControl
